Python-Module 9
# OVERVIEW
The purpose of this assignment was to help W. Avy determine on whether to open her icrecrem shop. They needed more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wanted temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. I was able to determine that for them and below are the results
# RESULTS
## June Temp
Based on the June temp analysis, we can see about 1700 observations made that month.I feel the sample size is big enough to determine on whether the surf and ice rean shop can work in June. Which I feel it can, because the temperatures are hot and most people are out and about in the summer

## December Temp
Based on the Decmeberune temp analysis, we can see about 1500 observations made that month.I feel the sample size is still big enough to determine on whether the surf and ice rean shop can work in Decemebr. Which I feel it can, because the temperatures are still hot and alot of tourists come during that time of the year

# SUMMARY
Overall, I think it will be a great idea to open the shop. Although, the temperatures remain pretty steady around the year, we could still have added other months, to our analysis to really determine the profits and losses of June and December, and also include other months.
